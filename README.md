# Snake Game

Hi!  
This is a fun little project that I decided to do a week before Valentine's Day. A bit rough?
Look up Pareto principle. 
It's implemented in Python using the Pygame library (and a given amount of help from Copilot).

## Installation

1. Make sure Python is installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Click the "snake_game.py file" and download the file.
   
3. Open your command window by writing cmd on your Start menu (on Windows) and press enter

4. Check if Python is installed correctly by running the command

   python --version.

5. Install the required dependencies with the following command in cmd:
  pip install pygame

6. To start the game, run the following command:
  python snake_game.py

Use the arrow keys to move the snake and eat the food.
Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body to continue playing. After eating a certain amount of food, a message will pop up!
