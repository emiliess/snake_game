# Snake Game

Hi!  
This is a fun little project that I decided to do a week before Valentine's Day. A bit rough?
Look up Pareto principle. 
It's implemented in Python using the Pygame library (and a given amount of help from Copilot).

## Installation

1. Make sure Python is installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   
2. Open your command window
   
3. Install the required dependencies with the following command in cmd:
  pip install pygame

4. To start the game, run the following command:
  python snake_game.py

Use the arrow keys to move the snake and eat the food.
Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body to continue playing. After eating a certain amount of food, a message will pop up!
